# Eircode-Finder
This is very much a work in progress and I am trying to replicate the auto-address app. I have a trial account with post-code that allows me to look up UK based postcodes. My trial account runs out on the 8th of April - https://developers.alliescomputing.com/
I'm combining the APIs for Google Maps and Postcoder to allow you to look up postcodes in the UK and with that I am using the details of the found postcode plus your current location to map a route. 
After you enter the postcode you are brought to a screen that shows the address for the postcode, at this point you have the option to save the location, get the directions from your current location or add it to your favourites. 
To run the app you need to install react-google-maps and materials-ui.

To start the application just type 8 letters into the search screen, due to my trial running out I have just defaulted the system to a start location.
